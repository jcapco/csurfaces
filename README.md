# Toolkit for Cubic Surfaces

This is a toolkit for computing many things regarding cubic surfaces.

## Installation

Currently I am providing `Maple` codes in `mpl` (text-based). This is work in progress

## Usage

See documentation in `Maple` codes

## Acknowledgement

Many thanks to the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria.

## Citing

Once there is sufficient content I will give instruction on how to cite. Currently, you can use the code as is and just name if you wish to cite.
